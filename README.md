# bspwm

A collection of my bspwm config files for each of my setups based on it.

To use any the setups, follow the steps bellow:

1. Install `xorg-server`,  `xorg-xinit`,  `bspwm`, `sxhkd`, `polybar`, `font awesome ` and an `x` compositor of your liking
2. Copy the contents of the desired setup to `~/.config/bspwm/`
3. Copy the contents of the desired `polybar` setup to `~/.config/polybar/`
4. Copy the contents of the `sxhkd` directory to `~/.config/sxhkd`
